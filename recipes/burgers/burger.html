<h2>Want to make a delicious classic burger?</h2>
<p>
    Sink your teeth into a delicious restaurant-style, hamburger recipe made from lean beef. <br>
    Skip the prepackaged patties and take the extra time to craft up your own, and that little extra effort will be worth it. <br>
    To make cheeseburgers, about 1 minute before burgers are done, top with sliced cheese; continue cooking until cheese begins to melt.
